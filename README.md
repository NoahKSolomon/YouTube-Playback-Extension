# YouTube-Playback-Extension
Source code for a chrome extension which allows you to set the default playback speed of YouTube videos along with some hotkeys for setting the playback speed in the current tab.

To use this extension, download the source, open Chrome, navigate to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, click 'load unpacked', naviagte to and select the source code main folder, then you should be good to go.
I have not published this to the Chome store because I don't want to pay the fee to publish.
